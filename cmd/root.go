	Long: `This is a highly-opinionated CLI tool to sync git stacked branches/PRs to your remote repository.

	gsp is useful when you have multiple branches in a repository and you want to keep them in sync.
	For example:
	* Create a new stack
	* Add a new branch to a stack
	* List all stacks
	* Delete a stack
	* Sync a stack

	gsp will make your life easier where you have to travel all the branches in a stack to keep them in sync.`,
	// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.gsp.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
